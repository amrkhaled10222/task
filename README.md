# Task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
1- Advanced Networking and Data Handling:
- Build a mobile network layer for an application, focusing on error handling, exception management, and request
interception/synchronization. Use a modern programming language/framework (e.g., Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android,
or Dart) and provide documentation/unit tests.

1. Setting Up Packages
Ensure that your project is configured to use these packages correctly within your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the package dependencies to your pubspec.yaml file.

2. Create a Network Service
Inside the api_service package, create a Dart class responsible for making API requests. You can utilize the dio package for basic HTTP requests.

3. Implement Error Handling
Handle errors returned by API requests within your network service class. You can create custom exceptions or use built-in error handling mechanisms.

4. Request Interception and Synchronization
If needed, implement request interception within your network service class. Ensure that requests are synchronized and don't interfere with each other.
